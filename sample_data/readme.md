# Example data I'm working with

The [sample_earthquake_response.json](sample_earthquake_response.json) shows the json repsonse I get from the API endpoint from the [USGS]('https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/').

This nested json is denormalized using python in my airflow DAG.

The final state of the raw data is represented as [sample_earthquake_response_flattened.csv](sample_earthquake_response_flattened.csv).
